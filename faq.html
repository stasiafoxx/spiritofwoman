           <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
           <h2 class="faq-questions">Are there any requirements for me to be able to receive Spirit Of Woman's services?</h2>
           <p class="faq-answers">In order to participate in services, you must be a female who is 18 years of age or older. 
           You must be pregnant or parenting, or seeking recovery and intervention from substance abuse/dependency.</p>
           <h2 class="faq-questions">If I can't afford the treatment costs, can I still participate?</h2>
           <p class="faq-answers">Spirit Of Woman receives referrals from CPS, Cal-Works and Probation/Parole. 
           Spirit Of Woman can assist in identifying a funding agency for your treatment if you cannot afford it.
           If you do not qualify for funding from available agencies, you will be placed on a waiting list for a County funded Department of Behavioral Health bed.</p>
           <h2 class="faq-questions">If I qualify to enter under a County funded bed, what is the wait time before I can enter?</h2>
           <p class="faq-answers">Depending on your priority status, the wait time could range from twenty-four hours to one year. 
           During the waiting period, Spirit Of Woman personnel will stay in contact with you regularly, providing referrals to other programs and services, 
           including medical care, psychiatric care and NA/AA support systems. Spirit Of Woman also provides a monthly support group for women waiting to enter treatment.</p>
           <h2 class="faq-questions">How many children can enter the program with me?</h2>
           <p class="faq-answers">Currently, Spirit Of Woman will allow each mother to bring in up to two children to reside with her.
           If you are pregnant during admission and you deliver your child you can have up to three children in residence with you.</p>
           <h2 class="faq-questions">Do you allow family members to attend treatment together?</h2>
           <p class="faq-answers">Yes. Spirit Of Woman has seen several women in the program who were related to another participant. 
           We believe in addressing the family system and dynamics through therapeutic and educational interventions. 
           Recovery is exclusive to each individual and the treatment and recovery plan is designed accordingly.</p>
           <h2 class="faq-questions">Do you allow overnight visits with any children if they do not reside onsite with the mom?</h2>
           <p class="faq-answers">No. Spirit Of Woman's facility is not large enough to accommodate additional children to visit overnight.
           Children can visit their mothers on Friday and Saturday, between 1 and 4 PM. Additionally, the counselor can approve visits outside of normal business hours if the circumstance warrants the exception.</p>
