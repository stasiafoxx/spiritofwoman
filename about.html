      <h1>About Spirit of Woman</h1>
      <p>Since 1997, Spirit Of Woman has provided and managed treatment programs for 
      pregnant and parenting women in need of substance abuse intervention. 
      Spirit Of Woman provides this type of support through inpatient aftercare, 
      and sober living programs.

      From 1997 to 2000, Spirit Of Woman leased facilities through another organization 
      that served as its fiscal agent. In 2000, the organization was incorporated as a 
      nonprofit and leased a 24-unit apartment complex that served over 30 women and 75 
      children daily. In 2004, Spirit Of Woman relocated to its current site where it 
      can provide inpatient services for 70 women and 105 children, making it one of the 
      primary residential substance abuse treatment facilities for women with children in Fresno County.</p>
      
      <p><img class="image"src="images/AudreyRiley.jpg" alt="Audrey Riley" height="400px" width="400px">Audrey Riley, the founder 
      and current Executive Director of Spirit of Woman, was named one of the Top Ten Business and Professional Women of the Year for 2003. 
      Ms. Riley received this prestigious award in recognition of her accomplishments in developing and implementing a successful substance 
      abuse treatment program that continues to serve women and their children throughout Fresno County.
      On January 31 of 2002, Ms. Riley was honored with the Temple Beth Israel Social Action Award. Previous Mayor Alan Autry of Fresno County proclaimed that this date would be recognized as â€œAudrey Riley Day". The organization has formally adopted this day as a holiday for both staff and clients. In 2008 she received the African American Heritage Award for Non-Profits. The Community Heroes Award was given to her in 2011 by the College of Health and Human Services for Fresno State University. Ms. Riley was also recognized in October 2012 for her dedication to improving the perinatal system of Fresno County as one of the first members of the Fresno County Screening, Assessing, Referral, and Treatment Leadership Group (SART).
